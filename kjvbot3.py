Initiated by a randomly selected three-word starting phrase, 
kjvbot builds its utterance as a Markov chain based on a randomly 
selected series of three start words and a selection from the KJV 
Bible (prophets, Gospels, or Revelation, or the whole KJV) and then, 
if it is <= 130 characters, tweets it to @kjvbot.
