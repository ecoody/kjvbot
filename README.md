# kjvbot
Repository of work in progress by Timothy Beal, Case Western Reserve University, and Michael Hemenway, Iliff School of Theology, with patient instruction and tremendous help from Justin Barber, and in collaboration with Micah Saxton and Pamela Eisenbaum. Our main focus so far has been kjvbot.py, a little markovian bot that autogenerates King James Version biblical sounding utterances and sends them as tweets to @KJVBot via Twitter's API.

Within the kjvbot1.py and kjvbot2.py, the generation of the utterance is initiated by a randomly selected three-word biblical phrase (selected from a list of common biblical opening lines, like "Woe unto thee" or "The kingdom of") within all (kjvbot1) or specific parts (kjvbot2) of the KJV Bible text. The program then proceeds to build the utterance, as a Markov chain, from next word to next word, until it reaches its own full stop. If the autogenerated utterance is </= 135 characters, it is sent to @KJVBot; if it's over 135, it loops back to the top and starts over.

Kjvbot3.py is a set of functions that can be imported and used to autogenerate utterances from virtually any body of text. Random_kjv_bot.py provides an example of how it could be utilized.

The markovizer programs function very like kjvbots 1 and 2, except that they don't send updates to Twitter. Version 1 autogenerates from a single start word based on the whole KJV Bible. Version 2 begins with three start words and a fileid specified by the user.

Kjvbot_beta.py is where we began. Built from code behind @TheHigherDead, this module generates biblical mashups as sequences of randomly selected formal elements from the prophets and Psalms and tweets them to @KJVBot.
