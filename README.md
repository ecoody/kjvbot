# kjvbot
Repository of work in progress by Timothy Beal, Case Western Reserve University, with tremendous and patient instruction and help from Justin Barber and Michael Hemenway, and in collaboration with Micah Saxton and Pamela Eisenbaum. My main focus so far is kjvbot.py, a little markovian machine learner that autogenerates KJV Bible sounding utterances based on reading all or part of the KJV Bible text and then sends them as tweets to @KJVBot on Twitter.
