# kjvbot
Repository of work in progress by Timothy Beal, Case Western Reserve University, with tremendous and patient instruction and help from Justin Barber and Michael Hemenway, and in collaboration with Micah Saxton and Pamela Eisenbaum. My main focus so far is kjvbot.py, a little markovian machine learner that autogenerates KJV Bible sounding utterances based on reading all or part of the KJV Bible text and then sends them as tweets to @KJVBot on Twitter.

Within the function, the generation of the utterance is initiated with a randomly selected three-word biblical phrase (selected from a list of common biblical opening lines, like "Woe unto thee" or "The kingdom of") within all or part of the KJV text, and then proceeds, as a Markov chain, from next word to next word, until it reaches its own full stop. If the autogenerated utterance is equal to or below 140 characters, the function sends it to @KJVBot as an update via API; if it's over 140, it loops back to the top and starts over.
